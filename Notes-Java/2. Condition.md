## `if-else` vs. `switch`

**`if-else` Usage:**
- **Complex Conditions**: For testing complex or range-based conditions. Example: `if (x < 10) {...}`.
- **Variable Conditions**: When conditions are variables or non-constant expressions.
- **Few Conditions**: More readable for a small number of conditions.
- **Non-integer Comparisons**: Ideal for comparing strings or objects. Example: `if (str.equals("Hello")) {...}`.

**`switch` Usage:**
- **Multiple Constant Conditions**: Best for comparing one variable against multiple constants. Example: `switch (day) { case MONDAY: ... case TUESDAY: ... }`.
- **Clarity with Many Cases**: More organized for many constant values, like enum cases.
- **Performance**: More efficient for a large number of conditions.
- **Default Case Handling**: Includes a `default` case for unexpected values.

**Important for `switch`:**
- **Use `break`**: Essential to prevent fall-through. Example: `switch (x) { case 1: ... break; case 2: ... break; }`.

##  Logical Operations

In Java, the terms "短路与", "逻辑与", "短路或", and "逻辑或" refer to logical operations used in programming. Here's their meaning in English:

1. **短路与 (Short-Circuit AND)**: Represented by `&&`. This is a logical operation that evaluates to true if both operands are true. However, it's "short-circuiting", which means if the first operand evaluates to false, the second operand is not evaluated, since the overall expression cannot possibly be true.

2. **逻辑与 (Logical AND)**: Represented by `&`. This is also a logical AND operation, but unlike the short-circuit version, it evaluates both operands regardless of the value of the first operand. This can be important if the second operand has side effects (like a method call that changes state).

3. **短路或 (Short-Circuit OR)**: Represented by `||`. This is a logical operation that evaluates to true if either of its operands is true. It's short-circuiting, meaning if the first operand evaluates to true, the second operand is not evaluated, as the overall expression will be true regardless of the second operand's value.

4. **逻辑或 (Logical OR)**: Represented by `|`. This is the non-short-circuit version of the logical OR operation. It evaluates both operands even if the first one is true.

In summary, the short-circuit versions (`&&` and `||`) improve performance by not evaluating the second operand when it's not necessary to determine the result of the expression. The non-short-circuit versions (`&` and `|`), on the other hand, always evaluate both operands, which can be useful in certain scenarios but is generally less efficient.


In Java, the concepts of "short-circuit AND" & "logical AND", as well as "short-circuit OR" & "logical OR", represent distinct logical operators for Boolean comparisons and operations. Here is a succinct explanation:

### Short-Circuit AND (`&&`)
- **Symbol**: `&&`
- **Usage**: Employed when immediate determination of falsehood is possible. If the first operand is `false`, the expression resolves as `false` without evaluating the second operand.
- **Example**: `if (a > 10 && b < 5)`. Should `a > 10` be `false`, the evaluation of `b < 5` is bypassed.

### Logical AND (`&`)
- **Symbol**: `&`
- **Usage**: Similar in function to short-circuit AND, but evaluates both operands irrespective of the first operand's value.
- **Example**: `if (a > 10 & b < 5)`. Both `a > 10` and `b < 5` are evaluated, regardless.

### Short-Circuit OR (`||`)
- **Symbol**: `||`
- **Usage**: Utilised for immediate truth evaluation. If the first operand is `true`, the expression is deemed `true`, omitting further evaluation.
- **Example**: `if (a > 10 || b < 5)`. If `a > 10` is `true`, `b < 5` is not considered.

### Logical OR (`|`)
- **Symbol**: `|`
- **Usage**: Works akin to short-circuit OR, yet always proceeds to evaluate both operands.
- **Example**: `if (a > 10 | b < 5)`. Both `a > 10` and `b < 5` are subject to evaluation, irrespective of individual outcomes.

In Java programming, short-circuit operators (`&&` and `||`) are favoured for their efficiency, curtailing unnecessary computations upon determination of the expression's result. Logical AND (`&`) and OR (`|`), meanwhile, find use in scenarios necessitating the evaluation of all operands.
