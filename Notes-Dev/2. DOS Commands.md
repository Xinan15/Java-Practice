### Common DOS (Disk Operating System) commands

1. `cd`
    - **Change Directory**: Used to change the current directory and navigate to different directories.

    - Example: `cd path\to\your\java\project`

2. `dir`
    - **Directory**: Lists the files and folders in the current directory.

3. `javac`
    - **Java Compiler**: Compiles Java source code into bytecode. 
    - It transforms `.java` files into `.class` files that can be executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
    - Example: `javac MyProgram.java`

4. `java`
    - **Java**: To run a Java program.
    - Example: `java MyProgram`

5. `mkdir`
    - **Make Directory**: Creates a new directory.
   - Example: `mkdir com\myapp`

6. `rmdir`
    - **rmdir (Remove Directory)**: Deletes a directory. It's useful for cleaning up or reorganizing the project structure.
   - Example: `rmdir com\myapp`

7. **del (Delete)**: Used to delete one or more files.
   - Example: `del MyProgram.class`

8. **copy (Copy Files)**: Copies one or more files from one location to another. This can be used to move compiled Java classes or resources.
   - Example: `copy path\to\source\file.class path\to\destination`

9. **move (Move Files)**: Similar to copy, but it moves the files instead of copying. Useful for reorganizing files within a project.
   - Example: `move file1.java src\com\myapp`

10. **path (Set Path)**: Sets or displays the command path. This is particularly important in Java development for setting the path to the JDK binaries.
    - Example: `path %path%;C:\path\to\jdk\bin`

11. **set (Set Environment Variable)**: Used to set environment variables like `JAVA_HOME`, which is commonly used in Java development to define the location of the JDK installation.
    - Example: `set JAVA_HOME=C:\path\to\jdk`

12. **echo (Display Message)**: Displays messages or turns command echoing on or off. It's often used in batch files for displaying status messages.
    - Example: `echo Compiling Java files...`

These commands are essential for managing files and directories, compiling and executing Java programs, and setting up the development environment in a DOS-based operating system.
