When designing code in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with Java, several key aspects should be considered to ensure the creation of efficient, maintainable, and scalable software. Here are some of the primary considerations:

1. **Encapsulation**: Encapsulating data (making fields private) and providing public methods to access and update these fields ensures that the internal representation of an object is hidden from the outside. This promotes data integrity and reduces dependencies.

2. **Inheritance**: Leverage inheritance to promote code reuse and establish a hierarchy between classes. It allows a new class to inherit properties and methods of an existing class, enhancing code organisation and reducing redundancy.

3. **Polymorphism**: Polymorphism allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class rather than their actual class. It enhances flexibility and enables a more generalized approach to programming by using interfaces or abstract classes to define methods that can be overridden by derived classes.

4. **Abstraction**: Abstracting away complex implementations behind simple interfaces is crucial. It simplifies the external interface of an object and separates the concerns between the interface and implementation.

5. **Cohesion and Coupling**: Aim for high cohesion (related functionalities within a single class) and low coupling (minimal dependencies between classes). This makes your code more modular, easier to understand, maintain, and test.

6. **SOLID Principles**: These principles are fundamental in OOP design for building robust and maintainable software:
   - Single Responsibility Principle: A class should have only one reason to change.
   - Open/Closed Principle: Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
   - Liskov Substitution Principle: Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without affecting the correctness of the program.
   - Interface Segregation Principle: No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use.
   - Dependency Inversion Principle: Depend on abstractions, not on concretions.

7. **Design Patterns**: Familiarize yourself with common design patterns like Factory, Singleton, Observer, Strategy, etc. These are proven solutions to common problems in software design and can greatly enhance the efficiency and readability of your code.

8. **Error Handling**: Proper error handling is crucial. Instead of using system exits or print statements, use exceptions to handle unexpected situations. This approach is more robust and helps with debugging and maintenance.

9. **Code Readability and Conventions**: Write code that is easy to read and understand. Follow Java naming conventions, maintain consistent indentation, use meaningful variable and method names, and include comments where necessary.

10. **Testing and Documentation**: Regular testing (unit tests, integration tests) is essential to ensure your code behaves as expected. Additionally, proper documentation (Javadoc and in-line comments) is crucial for others to understand your code.

Incorporating these aspects into your OOP design in Java will help create a solid, maintainable, and scalable application or system.
