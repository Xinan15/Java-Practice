## Java Exceptions

When executing Java code, different errors can occur: coding errors made by the programmer, errors due to wrong input, or other unforeseeable things.
<br>

When an error occurs, Java will normally stop and generate an error message. The technical term for this is: `Java will throw an exception` `(throw an error)`.

### try and catch
The `try` statement allows you to define a block of code to be tested for errors while it is being executed.<br>

The `catch` statement allows you to define a block of code to be executed, if an error occurs in the try block.
