    Sum of Prime Numbers
    Consider 2 as the first prime number, 3 as the second, 5 as the third, and so forth.
    
    Given two integers, n and m, where 0 < n ≤ m ≤ 200, your programme is required to calculate the sum of all prime numbers from the nth to the mth prime number, inclusive of both. 
    It's important to note that the sum should include all prime numbers between the nth and mth prime numbers, and not merely all prime numbers between n and m.
    
    Example Input:
    2 4
    Example Output:
    15
